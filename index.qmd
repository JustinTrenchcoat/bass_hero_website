title: "Bass Hero Project Website"
---

This website will hold Notes, code pieces and some other stuff that I would use for the Bass Hero Project.

This project would have the following phases:

1. Music Theory Part: all necessary music theory knowledge about bass would be uploaded to this page as one part of the theoretical foundation of this project.

2. Modelling Part: Will build a mathematical model that looks into finger positions and bass sheets.

3. Machine Learning Part: A machine learning algorithm that automatically transforms music into bass sheets. 

4. Package Part: all functions used will be packaged.

More to come...
