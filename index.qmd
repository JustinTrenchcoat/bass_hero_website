title: "Bass Hero Project Website"
---

This website will hold Notes, code pieces and some other stuff that I would use for the Bass Hero Project.

This project would have the following phases:
1. music theory part: all necessary music theory knowledge about bass would be uploaded to this page as one part of the theoretical foundation of this project.
2. modelling part: Will build a mathematical model that looks into finger positions and bass sheets.
More to come...
